The dataset described by the following visualizations pertains to the challenger incident of 1986. It contains information about o-ring damage, temperatures on the day of the launch, as well as flight indices.
To view the websites, simply open the html files (scatterplotMatrix.html or parallelCoordinates.html) in a browser (the associated javascript files must be in the same directory). This can be easily done by running a python3 server in the root directory and navigating to the desired files in the browser.
Interactions with the visualizations are simple. In the scatterplot matrix it is possible to mouseover points to highlight them and display their values. Further, clicking on a point will highlight the data item in all of the plots. In the parallel coordinates site, data paths are also highlightable and clickable using the mouse.
